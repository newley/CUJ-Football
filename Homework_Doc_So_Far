Homework Two

Overview:

For this assignment, we created a way to pull data from Twitter to gauge score predictions for a closely watched soccer game in England.

The match we targeted was one between two London-based rivals, Tottenham Hotspur Football Club and Arsenal Football Club, two top sides in the English Premier League. The game kicked off at 4 p.m. London time on Sunday March 3, 2013.

Strategy:

Our goal was to pull Tweets from the Twitter API based on the specific text users employed to describe the game. 

We searched Tweet according to two common hashtags and a representative string of text. These search terms were:

#thfcvafc
#thfcvsafc
tottenham arsenal prediction

(The two hashtags are based on abbreviations for Tottenham Hotspur Football Club vs. Arsenal Football Club.)

After importing the data from relevant Tweets, we created a loop in which we isolated the Tweets’ text from other information.

 
Our code was as follows:

#set up API call

from urllib import urlopen
from urllib import urlencode


#create a url to look for the last 100 search results with #thfcvafc

prefix = "http://search.twitter.com/search.json"
urlencode ({"q":"#thfcvafc"})
urlencode ({"q":"#thfcvafc","rpp":100})
urlencode ({"q":"#thfcvafc","rpp":100,"result_type":"recent"})
suffix = "?"+ urlencode({"q":"#thfcvafc","rpp":100,"result_type":"recent"})
url = prefix+suffix

#read the data

data = urlopen(url).read()
from json import loads
response = loads(data)
tweets = response["results"] 

#isolate the text of the tweets from the data

for t in tweets:
if t("text"):
tweet = t["text"]

Next, we isolated the numbers representing scores.
